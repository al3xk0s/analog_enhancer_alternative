## AnalogEnhancerAlternative

This is an unofficial fork of the [AnalogEnhancer plugin](https://github.com/Rinnegatamante/AnalogsEnhancer) by Rinnegatamante.

It is simplified and designed to solve the problem with rubber pads that prevent the stick from reaching the final values.

Therefore, besides the dead zone at the beginning, it also scales further values in such a way that the actual edge of the stick (rubber) becomes the maximum value at the program level.

### TODO
